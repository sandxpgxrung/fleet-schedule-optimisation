task 1 = dijkstars algorithm https://pypi.org/project/Dijkstar/ 
nearest-neighbour clustering? (either knn or notion-based) -> align with dijkastars algorithm?
^ NB; doesn't consider ovr path length, only considers the coord differences
-> gives quick solution (BSF -> Best First Search) -> DISADV. -> dijkstar alg. == no backtrack

task 2 = genetic algorithm from scratch
random-clustering? -> align with the randomness of genetic algorithm? (otherwise nearest-neighbour)
-> explores solutions more optimally per iteration
